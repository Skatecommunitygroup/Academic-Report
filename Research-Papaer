K-12th Graders' Research Paper
The school report serves as both an academic and personal snapshot of a student’s application, and can be a crucial starting point for admission officers in assessing candidacy. K-12th graders’ research papers are crucial for understanding educational trends, developing effective teaching strategies, and improving student outcomes. They provide insight into curriculum development, education psychology, and learning methodology while informing policymakers and educators on how to enhance the learning environment.
K-4th Graders
K-4th graders will be learning scientific and engineering practice of balance. Participants will be judged on their ability to perform without touching the wood floor with their knee and above the knee.
4th-8th Graders
The 4th-8th graders will be learning scientific and engineering practice framework for strength. Participants will be judged on their ability to capture speed moving through space.
9th-12th Graders
The 9th-12th graders will be learning scientific and engineering practice framework grace. Participants will be judged on their angles, body expressions, and facial expressions while performing.
12th-College Students
The 12th-College participants will be learning the scientific and engineering practice of participation and crowd reactions. College participants will judge the experience of their performance. Participants will be judged on specific criteria. Good posture is important to balance and center the body’s weight over the feet. This can reduce the likelihood of injury and improve overall health and appearance of the performance. The flexibility enhances the athleticism of the performance and increases the range of motion in joints. Regular stretching exercises can help maintain or improve flexibility. Power in the body is essential because it provides the energy necessary for basic bodily functions, maintaining homeostasis, and enabling physical activity. The body converts four calories into energy through metabolic processes, primarily using glucose, proteins, and fats to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which cells use to perform vital tasks such as muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and cellular repair.
Ladies's Roller Skating Standards
the ladies's roller skating standard of study is footwork. The ladies's Roller skater technical skills result will be walking and rolling. Ladies will learn gaits, strides, crawling, swimming, kicking, jumping, height extension, and balance. Their research paper will be about proper posture and educational trends by visual representation of roller skates.
Men's Roller Skating Standards
The men's roller skating standard of study is wheels. Wheels are crucial for the smooth functioning of machinery as they reduce friction, allowing for easier movement and improved efficiency in mechanical systems. They are also essential for getting one where they want to go, as they contribute to speed, mileage, and the smoothness of the ride. The men’s roller skater technical skill result will be speed, mileage, and smoothness of the ride. Putting wheels on shoes essentially turns them into roller skates.  Shoes are important for maintaining proper posture. They help to distribute weight evenly across the feet, reduce the impact on the joints, and provide a stable base of support for the body. Their research paper will be about educational trends and how to produce a commercial success on roller skates.
Video Performance
Video performance primarily serves as a visual representation of artist. Enhancing the artist, enhancing the artist’s expression and storytelling of the music. Video performance is used to promote the song, engage audiences, and provide a creative platform for artists to convey their vision and message visually. Music videos can also help increase a song’s exposure and commercial success by reaching a broader audience through visual media.
Skate Sessions
The first skate session is about balance. To achieve proper balance, start by standing with the feet shoulder-width apart and the weight evenly distributed.  Then place the foot on the ground and carefully lift the other foot off the ground. Next, extend the arms out to the side and begin to shift the body weight, not the foot on the ground. Maintain a vertical upper body position and look straight ahead to keep the head and eyes up. Avoid leaning forward or backwards. Once the participant masters balance on roller skates. Strength comes from weight lifting, bodyweight exercise, or resistance band training into the routine in order to build strength with balance. 
Grace
Participant move to the next stage of grace. Keep your back and entire body straight. This helps to distribute weight evenly, making it more comfortable. Walk heel to toe smoothly to transfer the impact to the legs instead of the ball of the foot, and relax your hips and knees to be more fluid and graceful. The participant’s spiritual healing can have a positive impact on one’s well-being. The participant can improve comfort during difficult times and foster a sense of belonging in performance routines. The participant  must have artistic ability and creativity to express ideas through movement and create new and interesting dance routines. The participant must showcase the ability to perform without touching the wood floor with their knee.
Judges
Judges will respond with a penalty towards your performance. The speed of the participant’s performance through space is also judged. Newton’s third law of motion states that when two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Body language plays an important role in communicating as it can amplify, modify, confirm, or subvert verbal expression. According to a study by psychologist Albert Mehrabian on conveying emotions and attitude, nonverbal communication could account for up to 93% of the overall message, with words contributing only 7%. If the crowd reacts negatively or critically to your performance, keep the conversation productive by asking the judge, “What’s the one thing I can do to improve moving forward?” And request coaching to help you meet the goal. Demonstrating a grateful and forward-thinking attitude in the face of critiques can turn the situation into a favorable one.
